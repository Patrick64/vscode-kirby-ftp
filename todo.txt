Make menu for files/folders:
    Refresh
    
    Upload/Download on file
    Upload/Download on folder: Upload/Download changed files
    Mirror to remote
    Mirror to local



Add config file
IF there is no config file have message on treeview that opens the config file
Allow for more than one ftp profile
add sftp
Compare file view

Future:
    Add kirby-ftp folder to .vscode
    add a gitignore and htaccess that blocks access
    Sqlite database stores state of files:
        Wehn they were last updated on local/remote
        The size&date of when files were last the same (since last sync) to tell which one has changed
    Store different versions of text files:
        Maybe store as list of guids ie .kirby-ftp-ba5c5ba5bb5ca5 
        Databse stores file hash so it doesn't create lots of the same file
        Maybe compress them?
    If files have the same size&modified date as they have in the database then there's no need to compare them just go off the state in the database
    Show files that have changed on remote XOR local as syncable
    Show files that have changed on remote AND local as conflict (unless they can be automerged with node-diff3, then show as automergable)
    Automerge using node-diff3
    Open 3-way merge
    Store backups


    Add options:
    Sync local
    Sync remote
    Sync both
